We love Fark, but we don't always love the sources users submit and get the greenlight.  Filter through the noise with a simple block list for Fark.<br>
<ul>
<li>See a source you don't like?  Click the red 'X' to the left of the site logo, and never see that source again.<br>
<li>Prefer to open a certain domain in incognito?  Click the incognito icon.</li><br>
<li>Have you made a terrible mistake? Click the beer icon in your extension list and remove the precious domain.<br>
</ul><br>
Now, the folks over at the Chrome Extension factory don't seem to want this extension in their catalog.  So, I'm all done dealing with them.  If you want to use this extension, you'll need to load it manually.
<ol>
  <li>At the top of the github page, click the green "<> Code" button.</li>
  <li>Click "Download ZIP".</li>
  <li>Extract the contents of the zip somewhere safe.</li>
  <li>Open Chrome and in the url bar go to chrome://extensions</li>
  <li>In the top right, enable Developer Mode.</li>
  <li>In the top left, click "Load unpacked".</li>
  <li>Select the directory where you extracted the zip file, previously.</li>
</ol>

As for licensing.  I used AI to write this pig in ten minutes.  Go nuts.<br>
